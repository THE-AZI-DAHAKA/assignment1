            A great man once said 
            "Every 60 seconds in Africa a minute passes."
            The diverse meaning the quote possesses
            has yet to be discovered and experts fear
            that whatever secrets and mysteries the quote
            holds will simply be lost in the annals of time,
            without anyone realising the significance 
            it possesses.
